    <h1>Chicken Caprese Recipe</h1> <!--title on webpage-->

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Grilled Chicken</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts, Italian salad dressing, Italian herb seasoning, 
            and chicken seasoning into a resealable plastic bag, knead 
            bag several times to coat chicken with marinade, and 
            squeeze air from the bag. Seal and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours.</li>
       
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). </li>
        
        <li>Pour canola oil into a large cast-iron or ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Heat the oil until a small droplet of water pops in the oil. Remove chicken breasts from 
            marinade and discard used marinade. Place chicken breasts into hot oil, fry for 2 minutes, and flip chicken.</li>

        <li>Place skillet into the preheated oven and bake until chicken is no longer pink inside 
            and the juices run clear, about 12 minutes. Top each chicken breast with a slice of mozzarella 
            cheese and a tomato slice.</li>

        <li>Return to oven and bake until cheese has melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer chicken breasts to a 
            serving platter and top each with a basil leaf and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.</li>    
    </ol>
